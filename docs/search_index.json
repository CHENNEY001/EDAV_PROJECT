There is no expedient medication or treatment for recovering. Besides keeping social distances, wearing masks, etc., one of the most effective way for people not contaminating by COVID-19 is to take COVID-19 vaccine. People are encouraged to get COVID-19 vaccine by government and world health organization during the pandemic. We are now predicted to be at the end of COVID-19 pandemic due to high vaccination rate. At this time, we want to investigate on how people’s access and reaction to vaccine affect their vaccination rate. We compare based on different groups: ages, neighborhoods, religious, etc. in NYC, the most populous city in the United States. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research Topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research Topic Since the beginning of the pandemic, scientists over the world has been striving to develop vaccines to stop, or at least, slow down the spread of COVID-19. The vaccines are claimed to be effective in decreasing the severe case, hospitalization rate, and fatality rate by CDC.[1] However, there exists doubts on the effectiveness and safety of vaccines. Especially for children, the aged, and other groups with low immunity, whether vaccines bringing more benefits than harm is disputed. Furthermore, as the variants of the virus appear continuously, boosters targeted at the new variants come out subsequently. We might also curious about if people gradually lose the interests and trust in these new boosters. The opinion regarding these questions and the choice of getting COVID-19 vaccines might be influenced by multifarious factors, such as government policies, ages, races, and genders. In this project, we will focus on NYC, where the disease once breakout and caused huge loss to economics and public health. In NYC, there is requirement for employees who work in person or interact with public to be fully vaccinated until this November.[2] We are going to investigate the attitudes and choices of citizens in NYC towards COVID-19 vaccines through the status of vaccinations by different groups. To be specific, we are interested in whether people with certain characteristics are more likely to get vaccinated than other groups.

The data shows how vaccinations in NYC have progressed since December 2020 and routinely updated once a week on Thursdays. The data can be divided into two categories: doses and people. All data is currently stored in .csv files, and we can use read.csv() in RStudio to import the data. 2.2.1 doses/ The doses folder denotes the daily and cumulative administered doses number of the COVID-19 vaccine in NYC. Doses Administered: The number of COVID-19 vaccine doses that have been administered in NYC and reported to the CIR. This includes doses administered to residents and non-residents of all ages. Doses Number: Daily and cumulative information of vaccination. Data is divided into the two-dose, the one dose and booster. Dose 1 of 2: First dose administered of a two-dose primary vaccine series (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) Dose 2 of 2: Second dose administered of a two-dose primary vaccine series (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) Single dose: The dose administered of a single-dose primary vaccine series (Johnson &amp; Johnson) Additional/Booster 1: First booster doses administered after the primary COVID-19 vaccine series. Additional/Booster 2: Second booster doses administered after the primary COVID-19 vaccine series and one booster dose. There are some descriptions about the primary data and its format.

These data shows how many NYC residents have been vaccinated by borough, age, race/ethnicity and sex, and the cumulative administered doses numbers in NYC. Vaccination status is classified into the following categories: Partially Vaccinated: People who have received the first dose of a two-dose primary vaccine series. Completed primary series/Fully vaccinated: People who have received the two-dose series or the single-dose series. At least one dose: People who have received either the first dose of the two-dose or the single-dose, which includes people who are both partially and fully vaccinated. Therefore, it can’t be summed when doing statistic. Additional/booster doses: People who have received additional doses of an FDA-approved vaccine after completing their primary series. This includes first and second booster shots. Population estimates: The number of people vaccinated may exceed the estimated population and lead to more than 100% vaccination coverage, especially for smaller demographic categories and geographies. Population counts were calculated using estimates updated on October 9, 2020 to reflect annual population estimates for all NYC citizens. These estimates do not represent the 2020 Census or recent changes to NYC’s population as a result of in-migration or out-migration. Age groups: Data are reported for the following age groups: 5-12, 13-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85+ years. Among people under 18, only those aged 5 to 17 years are currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. There are some descriptions about the primary data and its format.
